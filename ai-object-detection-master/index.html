  <h3 class="new3">Object Detection </h3>
  <p class="new1">
    Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video. The goal is to detect instances of a particular class of objects, such as people, vehicles, animals, or other objects, and draw bounding boxes around them to indicate their location.

    Object detection algorithms typically involve two stages: a region proposal stage and a classification stage. In the region proposal stage, the algorithm identifies regions of the image that are likely to contain objects. These regions are then processed by the classification stage, which assigns a class label to each object and refines the bounding box coordinates.
    
    Object detection is used in a wide range of applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented reality. Some popular object detection frameworks include Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and SSD (Single Shot Detector).
